  "name": "Earth",
  "description": "Earth is the only planet in the Solar System that has life on it. Life exists because there is liquid water on our planet where two-thirds of the surface is covered with water. The sun is also at the right distance so that it provides warmth in the right measure, so that humans do not live hot or cold in very extreme weather. Earth is also enveloped by a gas called the atmosphere which gives air to breathe and protects us from meteorite impacts."
