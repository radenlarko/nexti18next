  "name": "Venus",
  "description": "Venus is almost the size of Earth, even so humans cannot live on this planet because the atmosphere is full of carbon dioxide which cannot be used for breathing. Venus is shrouded in clouds formed from deadly sulfuric acid. Venus rotates in the opposite direction to the other planets. The rotation is also very slow. One day on Venus equals 243 days on Earth."
